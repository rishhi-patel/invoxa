# 🚀 INVOXA – Microservices Platform

A modular, scalable, and cloud-ready **invoice-as-a-service** platform. INVOXA enables **authentication**, **client management**, **invoice generation**, **payments**, **notifications**, and **analytics** with a clean microservices architecture.

Built with ❤️ by **EXOcode Labs**.

## 🛠 Prerequisites

Before running locally, ensure you have:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) & npm (for Node-based services)
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) & pip (for Flask services)
- AWS CLI configured (for infrastructure deployment)
- Terraform (if deploying via IaC)

---

## 🚀 Running Locally

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/invoxa.git
cd invoxa
```

Start **all services** with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## ⚙️ Deployment

1. **Infrastructure Setup** (Terraform or AWS CDK) – in `/infra`
2. **CI/CD Pipelines** – via GitHub Actions
3. **AWS ECS/ECR** for container orchestration
4. **Route 53 + ALB + ACM** for domain and HTTPS setup
5. **Secrets Manager** for environment variables

---

## 📌 Planned Features

- ✅ JWT-based authentication
- ✅ Modular microservices
- ✅ MongoDB integration for persistence
- ✅ Analytics dashboard in frontend
- ✅ GitHub Actions-based CI/CD deployment
- ⏳ AWS S3 for file storage
- ⏳ Email + PDF generation with Puppeteer (Notification Service)

---

## 🧑‍💻 Local Development Workflow

Run **only a specific service** (see each microservice's README for details):

```bash
cd microservices/<service-name>
npm install
npm run dev
```

Run **frontend** separately:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
